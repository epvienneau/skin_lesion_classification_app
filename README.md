# skin_lesion_classification_app
The goal of this project is to make melanoma screening more accessible to patients by providing a public and free skin lesion classification smartphone app. Users will be able to create a user account (optional) and upload a single photo or multiple photos of their skin. Users will have the option of adding additional information such as age, sex, and family history. The images will be fed into a deep learning model trained on this dataset: https://isic-archive.com/#images . The model will determine if the lesion is benign or malignant and notify the user. If the user provides additional health information, this will assist the model in making its prediction and the confidence level will therefore be greater. The images, health data, and predictions will be stored in an encrypted database if the user chooses to create an account. Otherwise, this information will not be stored. Additionally, the user will have the ability to update his/her profile with official diagnoses of each skin lesion examined through this service. This data will be used to generate model statistics and may be used to update the deep learning model itself in the future. The user will also have the ability to upload multiple photos of the same lesion over time and link current photos to previous ones. This change over time information can be used to further inform the model and increase prediction accuracy.
